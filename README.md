# Stock & News Alert Script

This Python script monitors a stock's daily price changes using the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/).  
If the price moves significantly, it fetches related news from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and sends alerts via [Twilio SMS](https://www.twilio.com/).

### Features
